You're not just riding a wave here—you're riding geography itself, a rocky finger jutting into the Atlantic that's been sculpting perfect rights for millennia.\n\nThe locals will tell you that Anchor Point isn't Morocco's best wave. Hash Point is more powerful, Killer Point is longer, Boilers is more challenging. But what makes Anchor so special is its consistency. While other spots need that perfect combination of swell, wind, and tide, Anchor works 200+ days a year. It's the wave that turned Tagazhout from a sleepy fishing village into one of Africa's premier surf destinations.\n\nWhat surprised me most wasn't the waves—I'd seen the videos, read the guides. It was the community. Dawn patrol sessions with Moroccan rippers who grew up on these breaks. Sunset tagines at local cafes where everyone dissects the day's conditions. The Dutch couple who'd been \"visiting for two weeks\" three years ago and never left.\n\nIf you're planning a trip: November through March for the biggest swells, but September-October offers warmer water and smaller crowds. Book accommodation in Tagazhout village, not Agadir—you want to be able to check the surf from your window. And bring a 5/3mm wetsuit; the Atlantic here is colder than you think.",

This is the London AI Safety Hub's weekly meetup, and it's just one node in an ecosystem that's quietly making London the center of European AI safety research.\n\nThe math is compelling. DeepMind's headquarters in King's Cross. Anthropic's expanding London office. The UK AI Safety Institute at the Frontier AI Taskforce. Oxford and Cambridge churning out technical safety researchers. Government taking AI risk seriously after the 2023 Bletchley Summit. Add a timezone that bridges US West Coast and Asia, and you have a perfect storm.\n\nBut what makes London special isn't the institutions—it's the culture. Unlike SF's \"move fast and break things,\" London's AI scene carries a distinctly cautious flavor. Maybe it's the proximity to government. Maybe it's European sensibility about existential risk. Whatever it is, you can feel it in the conversations at Founders Forum, in the pitch decks at Seedcamp, in the due diligence questions from VCs on Sand Hill Row.\n\nThe technical talent density is extraordinary. Walk into any cafe in Shoreditch and you might overhear conversations about inverse reinforcement learning or debate the merits of different interpretability techniques. These aren't abstract academic discussions—they're practical concerns for teams building the next generation of AI systems. The city has quietly assembled one of the world's deepest benches of alignment researchers, many of whom previously worked at the frontier labs they're now trying to make safer.\n\nThe funding landscape reflects this maturity. London's AI safety investors don't just write checks—they understand the technical nuances. They can distinguish between genuine safety innovation and security theater. They know that solving alignment isn't about adding a safety layer; it's about fundamentally rethinking how we build AI systems. This sophistication attracts the most serious founders, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\nThe next wave is already forming. Every week brings new safety-focused startups: companies building interpretability tools, alignment testing frameworks, governance infrastructure. They're not asking \"can we build AGI?\"—they're asking \"when we do, how do we make sure it goes well?\"\n\nThe revolution won't be televised. But it might be livestreamed from a King's Cross conference room.",

      "body": "There's a pervasive assumption in AI development that safety is expensive. The \"alignment tax\"—the performance hit you take by constraining systems to be safe and beneficial—is treated as an unfortunate necessity. But what if we've got it backwards?\n\nConsider the traditional approach: build the most capable system possible, then bolt on safety measures afterward. It's like designing a Formula 1 car for pure speed, then trying to add seatbelts and airbags once it's already on the track. The safety features feel like compromises, limitations, costs.\n\nBut the researchers pushing hardest on alignment aren't accepting this trade-off. They're discovering something counterintuitive: systems designed with safety constraints from the ground up often end up more robust, more interpretable, and ultimately more useful than their unconstrained counterparts.\n\nTake scalable oversight—the challenge of supervising AI systems that might exceed human capabilities in specific domains. Traditional approaches struggle: how do you check the work of a system smarter than you? But techniques like debate, recursive reward modeling, and iterated amplification don't just solve the safety problem. They create systems that can explain their reasoning, identify their own uncertainties, and course-correct when they notice they're heading toward problematic outputs.\n\nOr consider interpretability research. Yes, being able to understand what's happening inside a neural network helps you catch dangerous behaviors. But it also helps you debug failures, improve training efficiency, and build systems that can actually teach humans rather than just produce opaque predictions.",

      "title": "Why Technique Beats Recipes",
      "description": "What celebrity chefs understand that cookbooks miss",
      "body": "Watch Gordon Ramsay teach someone to make scrambled eggs and you'll notice something: he barely mentions measurements. Instead, it's all about technique. The constant stirring. Taking the pan off heat just before the eggs look done. The residual heat cooking them to perfection. This is what separates celebrity chef content from recipe blogs—they're teaching you how to think about cooking, not just what to do.\n\nJacques Pépin demonstrating knife skills isn't really about cutting vegetables. It's about understanding leverage, blade angles, and the relationship between your cutting board and your ingredients. Once you understand the principles, you can apply them to any ingredient, any cuisine, any situation.\n\nThis is why Gordon Ramsay's \"perfect steak\" video has 50 million views. People aren't watching for the recipe—it's steak, salt, and heat. They're watching because he's revealing the mental model: why you baste with butter, why you rest the meat, why timing matters more than temperature readings. The recipe is simple; the technique is everything.\n\nMatty Matheson's legendary burger tutorial works the same way. Sure, he gives you ingredients, but what you're really learning is how to think about texture, fat content, and the science of the Maillard reaction. He's not teaching you to make his burger—he's teaching you to understand what makes any burger work.",
